# IAM: Art &amp; Science

Main idea: to see the difference between human and AI perspective on images under different 'tags'.

### Step 1
Get training data (human perspective) from Instagram under certain tags (for starters: 'art')

*Data will contain images and associated tags*

### Step 2
Build Generative adversarial network (GAN) to display AI perspective (distribution) of images associated with certain tag (for starters: 'art')

### Step 3
Conduct series of experiments on different models in order to find the most interpretable one

### Step 4 
Artists will provide their interpretation of AI drawing abilities
